### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned how to create elements like the img element, and how to store variables in it.
2. A document fragment is a set of nodes that aren't part of a document.
3. Always make sure to double check code and preview it on the index.html file! When you preview the .js file, nothing happens! And you'll be confused!
